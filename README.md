# Learning React Forms and maintaining data in state

## Shopping List
Create a component that displays a controlled input for 'New Item' inside of a form. When the form is submitted, Add the new item to an array in the state. When there is one or more item/s in this array, display the items on the page as a list

## Address Book
Create a component that displays three controlled inputs for 'Name', 'Email', and 'Phone' inside of a form. When the form is submitted, create a new object including all the properties from the form. Add this object into an array in the state. When there is one or more item/s in the array, display the details for each item as a list of contacts with their contact info below each.

## Color Picker
Create a component with two controlled inputs, 'Color A' and 'Color B', inside of a form. The fields should accept color values as input (you may want to use a 'color' type input for this). When the form is submitted, add a block that shows the gradient between the two colors. You will need to set a style attribute on this component and set the background using a linear-gradient. New form submissions should continue to add new blocks to the page.
